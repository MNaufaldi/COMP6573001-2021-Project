Team member:

# Overview
The project is going to be something similar to wikipedia / blog where it would display 3 categories that are available currently.
Categories:
1. Books
2. Cat
3. Food

# Backend
The backend will be using express, graphql, and mongo following the tutorial from
[Github link](https://github.com/tariqulislam/express-graphql-with-mongoose )

# Frontend
Frontend will be using React with axios that will connect to the backend.

# Others
I will be using Docker and maybe kubernetes. for load balancer I will be using nginx and for the deployment, I will probably deploy on Google cloud platform following the tutorial from [Udemy Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/)

Currently I have no mockups since I will not try to make the website pretty. The goal is to make the website functional with the features mentioned and have it deployed in time.
